## üß† How It Works

1. The user types a message into the input box.
2. Upon clicking the **Send** button, the message is passed to the `generate_reply()` function.
3. The function queries OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model using LangChain.
4. The model's response is displayed below the input box in the Streamlit interface.
